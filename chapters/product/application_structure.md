# Application Structure

Our app is a standard Rails application with a few interesting twists.

We have the standard folders:

    app/assets
    app/controllers
    app/models
    app/views

* `app/assets` contains all of the stylesheets and javascript files.
* `app/controllers` contains all of the controllers for serving all of the RESTful endpoints.
* `app/models` contains all of the models that control the objects.
* `app/views` contains all of the views (templates) that are displayed to the end user.
